# Home-Inventory
A Python Tkinter GUI application.

This motivation of this app is derived from the need for a system to keep track of stuff kept in boxes and trunk when one shifts homes from one city to another. Honestly, it gets cumbersome to maintain a diary and keep on adding and removing items from it every two to three years. The goal of this app is to do that for you.

The main features of the app are -
1. Adding Boxes - Can be of various kinds (Metal trunks, wooden crates, cardboard boxes, etc.)
2. Giving Alias - This gives an alternate way to segregate some boxes that contain the same type of items (Eg. Winter clothing, books, etc.)
3. Adding Items - Add the individual list of items in box.
4. Removing Items/Alias/Box - Incase you want to play around with some stuff.

Currently the app in under development and is open for improvement.
Following features are needed
- [ ] Adding a file management system - for multi user scenario, storing the info as a text file.
- [ ] Removing some bugs.
- [ ] Making this an executable application (Currently it's a simple python script)
